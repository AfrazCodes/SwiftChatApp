### [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Layout

The layout of the `InputBarAccessoryView` is made of of 4  `InputStackView`'s and an `InputTextView`. The padding of the subviews can be easily adjusted by changing the `padding` and `textViewPadding` properties. The constraints will automatically be updated.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathantannar4/InputBarAccessoryView/master/Screenshots/Layout.png">

It is important to note that each of the `InputStackView `'s to the left and right of the `InputTextView` are anchored by a width constraint. This way the `InputTextView` will always fill the space inbetween in addition to providing methods that can easily be called to hide all buttons to the right or left of the `InputTextView` by setting the width constraint constant to 0. The bottom and top stack views are not height constraint and rely on their `intrinsicContentSize`

```swift
func setLeftStackViewWidthConstant(to newValue: CGFloat, animated: Bool)

func setRightStackViewWidthConstant(to newValue: CGFloat, animated: Bool)
```

### Reactive Hooks

Each `InputBarButtonItem` has properties that can hold actions that will be executed during various hooks such as the button being touched, the `UITextView `text changing and more! Thanks to these easy hooks with a few lines of code the items can be easily resized and animated similar to that of the Facebook messenger app.

```swift
// MARK: - Hooks
    
public typealias InputBarButtonItemAction = ((InputBarButtonItem) -> Void)    
    
private var onTouchUpInsideAction: InputBarButtonItemAction?
private var onKeyboardEditingBeginsAction: InputBarButtonItemAction?
private var onKeyboardEditingEndsAction: InputBarButtonItemAction?
private var onKeyboardSwipeGestureAction: ((InputBarButtonItem, UISwipeGestureRecognizer) -> Void)?
private var onTextViewDidChangeAction: ((InputBarButtonItem, InputTextView) -> Void)?
private var onSelectedAction: InputBarButtonItemAction?
private var onDeselectedAction: InputBarButtonItemAction?
private var onEnabledAction: InputBarButtonItemAction?
private var onDisabledAction: InputBarButtonItemAction?
```
